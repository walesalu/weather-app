### Project Description:
In this exercise, you will be enhancing an API-centric web application. An API-Centric web application is a web
application that executes most, if not, all its functionality through the API calls. For this example, you will be
making API calls using the Apixu API, which is a free web service that allows users to obtain weather data for
developing weather apps. Apixu API is a RESTful API that uses JSON over HTTP for requests/returns and requires
an API Key for authentication. Figure 1, is a preview of the Seminole Weather Channel you will extend.
